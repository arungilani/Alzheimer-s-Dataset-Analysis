# Alzheimer-s-Dataset-Analysis
This is a beginner level Data Science project done during school in where I did some exploratory data analysis and machine learning on a dataset determining if someone had Alzheimer's or not.
# The dataset
The dataset was downloaded from this github- https://github.com/deepak525/Dementia-Classification-Compare-Classifiers

### Understanding the data
-The dataset includes the longitudinal collection of 150 samples aged 60 to 96. Each person had an mri scan done 2-3 times, for a total of 373 imaging sessions. 

-72 of the subjects were grouped as 'Nondemented' throughout the study.

-64 of the subjects were grouped as 'Demented' at the time of their initial visits and remained so throughout the study.

-14 subjects were grouped as 'Nondemented' at the time of their initial visit and were subsequently characterized as 'Demented' at a later visit. These fall under the 'Converted' category.

-The dataset consists of the following categories: education, socioeconomic status, mini mental state examination, clinical dimentia rating, estimated total intracranial volume, normalize whole brain volume, and atlas scaling factor.

-All of these categories were used in the ipynb to help predict whether a patient could be seen having Alzheimer's or not, depending on the status of these categories.
